AWS CLI Extensions
==================
A collection of plugins that extend the amazon command line utility.

About AWS CLI Plugins
---------------------
Although it's not very well documented, it's possible to write plugins for the
[aws cli][1]. [This issue][2] provides some details, and [this repo][3] led me
to having a working plugin.

For most common operations using the aws cli, using an [alias][4] is a simpler
way to add functionality to the aws cli.

In other more complex scenarios, where low-level access to the client is
required, or where some 3rd party is being integrated with, a plugin makes more
sense.

Writing a Plugin
----------------
* First, plugins must be importable:
```python
import aws_cli_plugins  # needs to work ...
```
* the plugin also needs a method called `awscli_initialize` which will inject the
new commands you're adding into the command table.
* your command (and subcommands) must inherit from the aws cli's [BasicCommand][5]
* your commands need to implement the `_run_main` method of `BasicCommand`

take a look at [s3][6] for a good reference on making subcommands and
interacting with the boto session.
